# Public Transit Model
by Holly Metzger and Beth Kellogg

for CMIS 202 at Frederick Community College with Professor Jonathon Southard

### Purpose
We are building this model to gather simulation data for our proposed
public transit solution to reduce traffic on I-270 between Frederick
and Washington DC. This will reduce travel time for commuters, CO2
emissions, injuries from car crashes, work needed to maintain the
highway, and will make Frederick county a more accessible and
attractive place to live.
